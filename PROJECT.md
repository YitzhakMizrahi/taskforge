# TaskForge

## Project Overview
A high-performance, real-time collaborative task management system built with Rust, demonstrating the language's strengths in concurrent operations and web development.

## Project Status
ðŸš§ In Development

## Documentation
- [Architecture](docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md) - System design and architecture
- [API Documentation](docs/api/API.md) - API endpoints and interfaces
- [Setup Guide](docs/setup/SETUP.md) - Development environment setup
- [Contributing](docs/contributing/CONTRIBUTING.md) - How to contribute
- [Development Rules](.cursor/rules/cursor-rules.mdc) - Development guidelines

## Objectives
- [x] Create a robust, scalable task management system (Foundation laid, V1 features implemented)
- [ ] Implement real-time updates using WebSocket
- [x] Build a secure authentication system (JWT-based, implemented)
- [x] Develop an efficient database schema (Initial schema with tasks, users, ownership implemented)
- [x] Create a comprehensive API (V1 for auth and task CRUD implemented)
- [ ] Implement file handling capabilities
- [ ] Add real-time notifications
- [ ] Ensure high performance under load (To be addressed in optimization phase)

## Technical Stack
- **Backend Framework**: Actix-web
- **Async Runtime**: Tokio
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **ORM**: SQLx
- **Authentication**: JWT
- **Real-time**: WebSocket
- **Serialization**: Serde
- **Caching**: Redis (optional)

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
- [ ] Project setup and structure
- [ ] Basic server configuration
- [ ] Database setup
- [ ] Basic API structure

### Phase 2: Core Features
- [x] User authentication
- [x] Task CRUD operations
- [ ] Basic real-time updates
- [ ] Team management

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] File attachments
- [ ] Real-time notifications
- [ ] Search and filtering
- [ ] Activity logging

### Phase 4: Optimization
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Caching implementation
- [ ] Load testing
- [ ] Security audit

## Current Focus
- Enhancing existing features (e.g., task assignment, further query options)
- Improving test coverage and writing more detailed test cases.
- Continuing documentation refinement and ensuring consistency.
- Planning for Phase 3 features (e.g., real-time updates, file attachments).

## Next Steps
1. Review and refine existing test suites for comprehensive coverage.
2. Plan and begin implementation of the next core feature (e.g., task assignment to other users, real-time notifications PoC).
3. Update `docs/setup/SETUP.MD` for consistency with `README.md` and current project state.
4. Regularly update `PROJECT.MD` and `CHANGELOG.md` as development progresses.

## Development Guidelines
- Follow rules in `.cursor/rules/cursor-rules.mdc`
- Maintain comprehensive documentation
- Write tests for all new features
- Review and update this document regularly

## Notes and Decisions
- Project named "TaskForge" to reflect its purpose of building and managing tasks
- Document important decisions here
